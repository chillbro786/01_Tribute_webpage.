Welcome to my inaugural project! Embarking on the path of a front-end developer, engaging in real projects is a crucial facet of honing one's skills. In this endeavor, I've crafted a straightforward web page paying tribute to Swami Vivekananda. As you navigate through your coding journey, consistent practice is key to continual improvement. Enclosed is the code for this project, and should you encounter any challenges replicating it, feel free to use this as a resource. May it aid you on your learning journey!
Do follow guys for more such projects !!!
